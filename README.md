# HanshowEpd
Modify and program the Hanshow 2.13 inch price tag as a EPD clock. 

## Overview
The Hanshow 2.13 inch price tag is very interesting device. It is a small MCU system with EPD to display the price. 
We can re-program it to realize some new functions. The goal of this repository is making an EPD clock.

It contains:
* 2.13 inch EPD
* MSP430G2553 MCU
* 25VQ21 256KB SPI Flash
* A7106 RF chip
